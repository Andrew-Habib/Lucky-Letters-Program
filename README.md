"Lucky-Letters-Program" 

This is an experimental program that was created in grade 11 as a high school project to apply knowledge attained regarding 2D lists. 

Process:
1) In this program two players continuously roll two dice (Two Random number generator from 1 to 6) each corresponding to row and column on a board.  
* Note: Each Player has a single list of letters
2) The dice values corresponds to a coordinate on a 2D board containing either a letter or no letter. If there is a letter, that letter will be removed from either the first or second player's list of letters.
3) This process repeats until one of the players losses all of their players in which case they have won the game

Although this game may not be a very useful nor entertaining game, it ideally encompasses the basics of list manipulation and functional programming.
